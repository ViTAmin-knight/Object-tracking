Overview

This project provides a Python-based object detection framework utilizing PyTorch, OpenCV, and other utilities for computer vision tasks. The core component, AIDetector_pytorch.py, defines a Detector class for object detection in images or video streams. The demo.py script demonstrates how to use the Detector class to process video input for object detection and tracking.
Requirements

    Python 3.x
    PyTorch
    NumPy
    OpenCV-Python (cv2)
    imutils

Optional for GPU acceleration:

    CUDA-compatible GPU
    Corresponding NVIDIA drivers and CUDA toolkit

Installation

    Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
    Install the required libraries using pip:

    pip install torch numpy opencv-python imutils

    If intending to use GPU acceleration, ensure your system has a CUDA-compatible GPU and the necessary drivers and CUDA toolkit installed.

Usage

    AIDetector PyTorch (AIDetector_pytorch.py): This script is used as a module and should not be run directly. It provides the Detector class for detecting objects in images or video frames.

    Demo Script (demo.py):
        Place a video file in an accessible directory and update the file path in demo.py accordingly.
        Run the demo script using:

        python demo.py

        The script will process the video for object detection and tracking, displaying the output in real-time.

Configuration

    The Detector class and the demo script can be configured by editing the respective Python files. For instance, you may wish to change the video input file or adjust detection parameters within AIDetector_pytorch.py.

Additional Notes

    The demonstration provided in demo.py is hardcoded to process a specific video file. Ensure to update the file path to your video of interest.
    This framework is designed for educational and demonstration purposes and may require adjustments for production-level applications.
    For detailed documentation on the PyTorch models used or specific image processing techniques, refer to the official PyTorch documentation and OpenCV-Python tutorials.
